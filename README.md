# pacquet

Experimental package manager for node.js written in rust.

TODO:

- [x] Tarball installation & extraction
- [ ] Install all dependencies of a package
- [ ] Update package.json
- [ ] Create a shrink file like `pnpm-lock.json` or `package-lock.json`

Commands:

- [x] init: `cargo run -- init`
- [ ] add: `cargo run -- add fast-querystring`
  - [ ] flags... 
- [ ] remove
- [ ] run

**Disclaimer**: This is mostly a playground for me to learn Rust and understand how package managers work.
